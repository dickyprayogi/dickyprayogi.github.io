### please talk to me i'm lonely
Want to get in touch with me, or stalk the rest of my online presence?

- My [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dickyprayogi) basically just repeats everything I wrote above but more professionally, I guess. (update: deactivated for the sake of mental health, hehe).
- Wanna look at my music taste? Me neither, but here's my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0SP4VjOT1uPkQFqQ7dIwze?si=cc7d38d038274cfc).
- I use Twitter ([@_dickyprayogi](https://x.com/_dickyprayogi)) more than I should. I will never call it 'X' because that is a stupid name.
- My Instagram ([@_dickyprayogi](https://instagram.com/_dickyprayogi), private). (update: deactivated for the sake of mental health, hehe).
- I don't really use TikTok ([@dkydaily](https://tiktok.com/@dkydaily)), but it's there, I guess.
